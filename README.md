# Adjust
An ios game made inside of xcode using spritekit. The goal of the game is for 
the player to swipe vertical platform groups up or down in order to adjust the gap 
between the platforms so that a red cube, which moves up and down, can pass safely. 
The player must do this for as long as they can, and the difficulty will keep increasing for 
a total of 5 times, the last difficulty of which the player will have a shot at collecting 
the reset difficulty power up that refreshes the speed of everything, allowing them 
to score more. 

## Known issues

1.) The game resolution currently only works on all iphone devices and the ipod touch. 
ipad causes the screen to get distorted. 

2.) There is no launch screen, since while trying to implement this, the 
letter boxing was getting shut off, which caused the resolution of the game to 
be bad also.

3.) For all other things, such as how to do animations, skactions, scene transitions, etc., I was able 
to fall back on my past IOS games for code references
